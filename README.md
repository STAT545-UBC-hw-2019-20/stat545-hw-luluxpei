### About Me

For those who have no idea who I am, here's a brief intro to hopefully make me seem less foreign :arrow_heading_down:

My name is Lulu, and I am currently a first year masters student studying **Biostatistics** at UBC. I know for some that might sound super intimidating, but it really is just applying statistical methods of finding patterns and relationships in data to the biological world. My background is in nutrition and immunology, so my interests lie in health science and epidemiology. However, a passion for quantitative analysis and understanding where experimental results come from has led me to the exploration of the *world of statistics*. 

Outside of school, I am a huge adventure-bug; swimming in oceans, hiking up mountains, camping in forests - that's my kind of life! You really can't get much better than Vancouver to satisfy all your spontaneous weekend getaway needs. It's the perfect city for all things outdoorsy!

As someone who always seeks positive growth through any and all situations, I'll leave you with one of my favourite quotes: 
> "Do not dwell on the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."
